# Splatoon2-KBMInterface
Computer program to interface with my take on the Switch Fightstick which uses UART to receive the commands, this program sends the commands to the ATmega32U4

program made in VB.NET

i made this program to use Mouse and Keyboard on Splatoon 2, it requires an ATmega32U4 device and a USB to TTL converter, the Atmel device goes connected to the Switch Dock and the converter on the computer

this program still has several bugs and inconvenients which i am still working on (like not being able to choose the COM port once compiled)
